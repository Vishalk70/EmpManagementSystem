# Employee Management System
I have created an employee management system using fontend framework React and tailwind css.
It is a project all about to manage employees with their assigned tasks.
This project was made strictly using React , tailwind CSS  and doesnot employ postgres connectivity.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
